Hi, my name is Carl and I am a computer science graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Computing.
I have a passion for programming and problem solving with code. My academic background and hands-on experiences have provided me with a diverse skill set that allows me to excel in problem solving for both complex and day to day issues. 
Alongside my love for programming, I have a keen interest in hardware and enjoy building computers, I've even designing my own computer case for a media server using laser-cut plywood.

Please take a look at some projects I've done to get a better picture of how I write code.
